python code for my thesis

It is an outlier detection problem seen as a binary classification task where it is tested if there is an effective machine learning model for the specific task
Two approaches are followed. The first utilizes supervised learning algorithms, while the second one utilizes unsupervised learning algorithms.

For this purpose there are two datasets of features that are being used, one with labels and one without labels. The latter is used only for the training of the unsupervised models.

The pipeline created is as follows:
	Normalization of the data
	Feature Selection
	Hyperparameter optimization
	Model fit
	Model evaluation
